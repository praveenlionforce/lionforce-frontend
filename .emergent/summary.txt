**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1:** The user request to make **form elements** (like input labels and placeholders) editable via the CMS has not been started.
-   **Issue 2:** The user request to make **icons** editable via the CMS has not been started.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Service Page Theming:** The user is very particular about the color schemes of the service pages. This has been a recurring point of feedback and requires careful attention to get final approval.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React, React Router, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
-   **Database**: MongoDB
-   **Architecture**: Full-stack with a decoupled frontend and backend. Content is dynamically fetched from the CMS.

**key DB schema**
-   **site_content**:  (Stores all editable content for each page, including nested objects for sections, pricing tables, etc.)

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   : The core of the CMS functionality.
-   : The custom hook for fetching all site content.
-   : Contains the API logic, including the public endpoint for content.
-   : Page requiring color change.
-   : Page requiring color change.
-   : Page requiring color change.
-   : Contains the dynamic pricing table.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The pricing table editor in  is currently specific to the  page. It could be abstracted into a reusable component if other pages require similar pricing tables in the future.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Submits contact form.
-   : **(New & Public)** Fetches editable content for a specific page.
-   : Saves updated page content (requires auth).
-   : Handles image uploads (requires auth).

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **User is highly visual and particular about colors.** Pay close attention to the latest color feedback. The proposed scheme is: eLearning (Purple/Violet), UX/UI (Slate/Cool Blue-Gray), Creative Services (Warm Coral/Terracotta). Get this right to avoid further iterations.
-   **The CMS is the centerpiece.** The user's primary goal is full control. Prioritize adding the remaining editability features (emojis, icons, forms) after fixing the colors.
-   **Test CMS changes end-to-end.** When adding editable features, always verify the full loop: change in admin -> save -> verify on the live page. Be aware of content caching in the browser and potentially on the backend DB.
